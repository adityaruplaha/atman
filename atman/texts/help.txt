    Name Searching Algorithm:
        The following are taken into consideration in serial order. 
        If the previous case does not match, the next case is applied.
        The entire algorithm is case-insensitive.
        Special Keywords:
            'all'  -> all students in name list
            'else' -> all students in name list who haven't been marked yet.
                      Pending changes are taken into account during this search.
        Startswith Search:
            Search for all students in list whose name starts with 'name_partial'.
        Contains Search:
            Search for all students in list whose name contains 'name_partial'.
        If no match is found, a warning is issued.

        If multiple matches are found, then the action is performed on all, and a
        warning is issued, with which the matches are mentioned.
